# Overview

- This is a *graduate level* introduction to *statistical learning*. 

- The course is *not* to teach you:
	- Support Vector Machine
	- Linear Regression
	- ...
	- Deep Learning

- Instead, you are going to learn *foundational tools* for developing *your own* models and algorithms.

# Course Format

- **No Exams**

- Topic driven

- For each topic:
	- Introductory lecture
	- Paper reading and Homework
	- In-class discussion

- You will present a paper/subject at the end of the course
